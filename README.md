This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Branches

* Tinymce - This branch shows how to implement the redux-form using the tinymce editor

* Ckeditor - This branch shows how to implement the redux-form using the ckeditor

That is why there was no real tought on how the structure the project or its files.
